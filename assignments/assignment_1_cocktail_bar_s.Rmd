# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
# Reading the raw dataset from the link
cocktails <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/refs/heads/master/cocktail_data.tsv", sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
# Collecting the texts to delete
units <- c("oz", "drops", "dashes", "dash", "drop", "bsp", "% abv") # Collecting the texts to be removed

cocktails_used <- cocktails %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "<b4/>|<br>", "<br/>")) %>% # Correcting false separators
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>") %>% # Separate rows by ingredient
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, paste0("\\b(", paste(units, collapse = "|"), ")\\b"))) %>% # Remove all units
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\.|\\/|\\([^)]*\\)")) %>% # Remove all unwanted special characters
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients)) %>% # Remove all unwanted whitespace
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "^[0-9]+\\s*[0-9/]*\\s*(?!proof)")) %>% # Remove all unwanted numbers
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients)) # Remove all unwanted whitespace
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
cocktail_ings <- sort(unique(cocktails_used$ingredients), decreasing = FALSE) # Creating the names of ingredients, each only once in alphabetical order
cocktail_ings
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
sum_ings <- length(cocktail_ings) # Length of the above created list = sum of ingredients
sum_ings
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
ing_times <- cocktails_used %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>% # Grouping by ingredients
  summarise(count = n()) %>% # Count how many times each ingredient appears in the list
  arrange(desc(count)) # Arrange in descending order

ing_thr <- ing_times$count[10] # Value of tenth element is what we need
top_10_ing <- ing_times %>%
  filter(count >= ing_thr) %>% # if the number of appearances in the list is bigger than the threshold...
  pull(ingredients) # ...get the ingredient
top_10_ing
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
cocktail_most_ings <- cocktails_used %>%
  group_by(name) %>%  # Group the cocktails by name
  summarise(num_ings = n()) %>% # Count the ingredients of each cocktail
  arrange(desc(num_ings)) # Arrange in descending order

cocktail_max_ings <- max(cocktail_most_ings$num_ings) # Get the maximum value of the above created list

cocktail_max_ings <- cocktail_most_ings %>%
  filter(num_ings == cocktail_max_ings) %>% # If the number of ingredients equals the maximum value...
  pull(name) # Get the name of the cocktail
cocktail_max_ings
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}
num_rare_ings <- cocktails_used %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>% # Group the cocktails by ingredients
  summarise(num_cocktails = n_distinct(name)) %>% # Sum up the number of different cocktails by ingredients
  filter(num_cocktails == 1) %>% # We need only the ingredients that appear in one
  nrow() # Count the number of rows
num_rare_ings
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
rare_ings <- cocktails_used %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>% # Group the cocktails by ingredients
  summarise(num_cocktails = n_distinct(name)) %>% # Sum up the number of different cocktails by ingredients
  filter(num_cocktails == 1) %>% # We need only the ingredients that appear in one
  pull(ingredients) # Get the name of these ingredients

rare_ings_cocktail <- cocktails_used %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ings) %>% # Select the ingredients which are rare
  distinct(name) # Get the names of the assigned cocktails
rare_ings_cocktail
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
no_rare_ings_cocktail <- cocktails_used %>%
  group_by(name) %>% # Group the cocktails by name
  filter(all(!ingredients %in% rare_ings)) %>% # Select the cocktails which have only ingredients which are NOT rare
  distinct(name) # Get the names of the assigned cocktails
no_rare_ings_cocktail
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}
cocktails_grouped <- cocktails_used %>%
  group_by(name) %>% # Group the cocktails by name
  summarise(ingredients = list(unique(ingredients)), .groups = "drop")  # Aggregate each ingredient into a list and after that we have to drop the grouping because of further manipulation of the resulted dataset

cocktails_expand <- cocktails_grouped %>%
  unnest(ingredients) # The columns with the list of ingredients expanded into individual rows

cocktails_matrix <- cocktails_expand %>%
  mutate(value = "X") %>%  # Mark each ingredient's presence with "X"
  pivot_wider(names_from = ingredients, 
              values_from = value, 
              values_fill = list(value = "")) # Creating the matrix with the names of cocktails, each of the ingredients and empty string if the ingredient does NOT appear

cocktails_matrix <- column_to_rownames(cocktails_matrix, var = "name") # Transforming the names of cocktails into names of individual rows
cocktails_matrix
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
