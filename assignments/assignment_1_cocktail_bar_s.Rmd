-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
# Reading the raw dataset from the link
# cocktail_data <- read_tsv("C:\\Assignment\\cocktail_data.tsv")
cocktail_data <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/refs/heads/master/cocktail_data.tsv", sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
# Collecting the texts to delete
units <- c("oz", "drops", "dashes", "dash", "drop", "bsp", "% abv")

cocktail_data_cleaned <- cocktail_data %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub("<br>", "<br/>", ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub("<b4>", "<br/>", ingredients)) %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>") %>% # Separate rows by ingredient
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, paste0("\\b(", paste(units, collapse = "|"), ")\\b"))) %>% # Remove all units
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\.|\\/|\\([^)]*\\)")) %>% # Remove all unwanted special characters
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients)) %>% # Remove all unwanted whitespace
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "^[0-9]+\\s*[0-9/]*\\s*(?!proof)")) %>% # Remove all unwanted numbers
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients)) # Remove all unwanted whitespace
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredient_list <- unique(cocktail_data_cleaned$ingredients) # Creating the names of ingredients, each only once
ingredient_list <- sort(ingredient_list, decreasing = FALSE)
ingredient_list
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
sum_ingredients <- length(ingredient_list) # Length of the above created list = sum of ingredients
sum_ingredients
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
ingredient_frequency <- cocktail_data_cleaned %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>% # Grouping by ingredients
  summarise(count = n()) %>% # Count how many times each ingredient presents
  arrange(desc(count)) # Arrange in descending order

threshold <- ingredient_frequency$count[10] # Tenth number is what we need
top_ingredients <- ingredient_frequency %>%
  filter(count >= threshold) %>% # if the number is bigger than the threshold...
  pull(ingredients) # ...get the ingredient
top_ingredients
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
num_cocktail_ingredient <- cocktail_data_cleaned %>%
  group_by(name) %>%  # Replace `cocktail_name` with your actual column name
  summarise(num_ingredients = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_ingredients))

max_ingredients <- max(num_cocktail_ingredient$num_ingredients)

most_ingredients_cocktail <- num_cocktail_ingredient %>%
  filter(num_ingredients == max_ingredients) %>%
  pull(name)
most_ingredients_cocktail
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}
num_rare_ingredients <- cocktail_data_cleaned %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(num_cocktails = n_distinct(name)) %>%
  filter(num_cocktails == 1) %>%
  nrow()
num_rare_ingredients
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
num_cocktails_per_ingredients <- cocktail_data_cleaned %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%
  summarise(num_cocktails = n_distinct(name)) %>%
  filter(num_cocktails == 1) %>%
  pull(ingredients)

cocktails_with_rare_ingredients <- cocktail_data_cleaned %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% num_cocktails_per_ingredients) %>%
  distinct(name)
cocktails_with_rare_ingredients
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
cocktails_without_rare_ingredients <- cocktail_data_cleaned %>%
  filter(!ingredients %in% num_cocktails_per_ingredients) %>%
  distinct(name)
cocktails_without_rare_ingredients
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}
# Create a matrix with cocktail names as rows and ingredients as columns
cocktail_data_grouped <- cocktail_data_cleaned %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(ingredients = list(unique(ingredients)), .groups = "drop")  # Aggregate into a list

# Step 2: Unnest the ingredients into separate rows
cocktail_data_unnested <- cocktail_data_grouped %>%
  unnest(ingredients)

# Step 3: Pivot into wide format, marking presence with "X"
cocktail_matrix <- cocktail_data_unnested %>%
  mutate(value = "X") %>%  # Mark presence with "X"
  pivot_wider(names_from = ingredients, 
              values_from = value, 
              values_fill = list(value = ""))

cocktail_matrix <- column_to_rownames(cocktail_matrix, var = "name")
cocktail_matrix
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
